Students in this course will work in accordance to the student honor code and the statement of academic integrity for Columbia University. Please refer to the Faculty Statement of Academic Integrity for all submissions of your work, and contact the instructor if you have any questions about a specific case related to the contents of this course. 

<span id="rTitle">HOMEWORK</span>

- Tutorials are assigned every 1-2 weeks and are designed to take no more than 1.5 hours to complete. They allows hands on experience with code that is addressed in class. They are cumulative and should be completed in sequence. Please contact the TA or Instructor when you encounter issues. 
- Submission Deadlines - Take home assignments are to be submitted before noon on Thursday via student’s individual websites. The TA and instructor will start reviewing submissions at that time.
- Completeness - Sometimes your code will have bugs that you cannot fix on your own. In those cases, please get in touch with your TA or instructor well ahead of the due date to address the issues together. 
- Code - Commenting your code and attributing code you use are required as part of every programming assignment. Writing comments inline with the code helps you to think through how to best complete particular programming tasks and also helps the instructor troubleshoot with you when there are issues. 
- Extra Credit - Throughout the semester, there will be opportunities to make presentations based on optional readings or completing code projects(demos) on special topics for extra credit throughout the term.
